There should be no reason for any code changes with the new Sinon 6. Usually, `MAJOR` releases should come with breaking changes, but there are no known breaking changes in `sinon@6` at the time of this writing. We chose to release a new major version as a [pragmatic solution to some noise related to releasing Sinon 5.1](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon/pull/1829#issue-193284761), which featured some breaking changes related to ESM (which since has been resolved).

If you should experience any issues moving from Sinon 5 to Sinon 6, [please let us know!](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon/issues/new?template=Bug_report.md).
