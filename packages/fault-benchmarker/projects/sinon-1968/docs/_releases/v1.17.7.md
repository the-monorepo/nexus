### Important: Sinon v1.x does not work with AMD/CommonJS Bundlers

Sinon.JS v1.x *as source* **doesn't work with AMD loaders / RequireJS / Webpack / Browserify**. For that you will have to [use a pre-built version](http://sinonjs.org/releases/).

This has been resolved in Sinon v2.x; Please don't report this as a bug.
