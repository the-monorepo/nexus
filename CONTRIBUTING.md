# Contributing

## Steps to contributing
1. Fork it
2. Make a new branch (meaningful name please!)
3. Write your code
4. Pull request :)

**Note:** Please use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) and commit your `yarn.lock` file.

## Editing EXAMPLES.md
Don't directly edit EXAMPLES.md. The examples markdown file is generated by `writeExampleMd.ts` so edit that instead.

Happy coding :)
