### Compatibility

### ES5.1

Sinon `{{page.release_id}}` is written as [ES5.1][ES5] and requires no transpiler or polyfills to run in the runtimes listed below.

### Supported runtimes

`{{page.release_id}}` has been verified in these runtimes:

* Firefox 45
* Chrome 48
* Internet Explorer 11
* Edge 14
* Safari 9
* Node 4

There should not be any issues with using Sinon `{{page.release_id}}` in newer versions of the same runtimes.

If you need to support very old runtimes that have incomplete support for [ES5.1][ES5] you might get away with using loading [`es5-shim`][es5-shim] in your test environment.
