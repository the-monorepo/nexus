CONTRIBUTING
============

Code style
----------

2-spaces indent

Dependencies
------------

We don't use range versions (`~x.y.z`, `^x.y.z`) for dependencies,
devDependencies, etc.

We're being conservative here for stability reasons. We're due to look over new
versions though.

Test
----

Check that your code passes the tests before submitting a PR:

    $ npm test
